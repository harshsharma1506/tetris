## Trippy Fuckin' Tetris 🕹️

This is a game which is tetris but not tetris, here you have buttons where we have co - ordinates mentioned, the X axis and the Y axis 😄. 
Best part is if you screw your co ordinates and make your shape enter the top at the very first time, you will lose .
Well, if are ever on an acid trip one can just randomly click on any co ordinates and have fun with the shapes this will unleash. 
I kind of liked this one

Anyway, the game is super hard or should I say I was super lazy ! But the game has its own purpose and bugs as well. It is just an abstract aesthetic piece of art. 
This is trippy in action ( Gosh ! it is beautiful )
